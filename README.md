# Travel Bot [applink](https://travel-bot-demo.herokuapp.com/)
Travel bot is an NLP-based bot that tries to understand and give appropriate responses when a user asks to "book a hotel/cab/flight".

***NOTE:** The web app is deployed on a free server which goes into sleep mode and takes about 10 to 20s to load, once loaded the bot will work as expected.*
